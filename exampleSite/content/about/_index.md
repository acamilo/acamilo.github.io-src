I’ve been a techie and a nerd. I was the kid with xmas lights and incandescent bulbs on his halloween costume and hypercard on his old MAC. Later on I got into Embedded programming with the basic stamp and products from pololu and wrote UIs for my projects using Real Basic on my old powerbook laptop.I arrived at WPI before there was a RBE major and went into electrical and computer engineering because it felt like the closest major to robotics.

In College I was a member of the IEEE student org on campus. I learned a lot about microcontrollers and electronics.  Me and my roommates liked to hack and tinker. We built a Guitar Hero bot that managed to get a perfect score on “Through the fire and flames” using an embedded linux board, some opto-isolators, and a broken Guitar Hero controller.

During my senior year me and some classmates started a Robotics Startup called Neuron Robotics. The goal was to develop a platform for teaching educational robotics. We stuck with it for quite a while and we even sold some hardware to WPI’s RBE department and got our product into Microcenter. Meanwhile I was also working as a researcher at the WPI AIMlab.

Now, I’m a talented driven engineer, Additionally I've touched all aspects of product design from concept, to parts selection, to schematic capture and pcb layout, to testing, production, and finally retail so i am confident in my abilities to hit the ground running.
